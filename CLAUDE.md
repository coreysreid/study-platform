# Agent Instructions

Before doing any work in this repository, read both project files below.
They are the single source of truth for conventions, architecture, and current state.

- [`project_longterm.md`](project_longterm.md) — platform vision, data model, content conventions, coding rules
- [`project_shortterm.md`](project_shortterm.md) — open PRs, recent decisions, immediate priorities

Do not rely on memory or inference for project conventions — read the files.
Update `project_shortterm.md` whenever work is completed or priorities change.
