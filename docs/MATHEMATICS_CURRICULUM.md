## Question Type Strategies

### Standard Q&A
Traditional flashcard format for definitions, theorems, and conceptual understanding.

### Multiple Choice
Present options for:
- Identifying correct formulas
- Selecting appropriate methods
- Recognizing patterns
- Eliminating incorrect approaches

### Step-by-Step Problems
Break complex problems into discrete steps:
1. Identify the type of problem
2. Choose the appropriate method/formula
3. Set up the problem correctly
4. Execute intermediate calculations
5. Arrive at the final answer
6. Verify the result

**Example for Calculus:**
- "What is the next step in differentiating f(x) = (3x² + 2)⁵?"
  - Identify outer function: u⁵
  - Apply chain rule: 5u⁴ · du/dx
  - Find du/dx where u = 3x² + 2
  - Substitute back

This approach helps students understand the logical flow of problem-solving and identify exactly where they struggle in a multi-step process.
