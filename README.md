## Database Models

- **Course**: Represents a subject/course
- **Topic**: Chapters or sections within a course with prerequisite relationships
- **Flashcard**: Question-answer pairs for studying with multiple question types
- **Skill**: Foundational skills/concepts for tracking learning foundations
- **MultipleChoiceOption**: Options for multiple choice questions
- **StudySession**: Tracks individual study sessions
- **FlashcardProgress**: Monitors progress on specific flashcards
- **Note**: User notes for topics

## Core Mathematics Curriculum

The platform includes a comprehensive Engineering Mathematics curriculum designed for students starting from a Year 6 foundation. See [docs/MATHEMATICS_CURRICULUM.md](docs/MATHEMATICS_CURRICULUM.md) for the full curriculum.

### Curriculum Highlights

**13 Progressive Topics:**
1. Basic Arithmetic & Number Sense
2. Algebra Fundamentals
3. Geometry
4. Trigonometry Fundamentals
5. Pre-Calculus
6. Differential Calculus
7. Integral Calculus
8. Multivariable Calculus
9. Linear Algebra
10. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
11. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
12. Fourier Analysis
13. Laplace Transforms

**Key Features:**
- Prerequisite tracking system - Topics show what must be mastered first
- 68+ foundational skill tags for targeted review
- Multiple question types: Standard Q&A, Multiple Choice, Step-by-Step problems
- Estimated 70-85 weeks of content at a steady pace

### Populating the Curriculum

To initialize the Engineering Mathematics curriculum in your database:

```bash
python manage.py populate_math_curriculum --user=<your_username>
```

This creates:
- The "Engineering Mathematics" course
- All 13 topics with descriptions
- 68 foundational skills
- Prerequisite relationships between topics

The curriculum provides the structure; the next phase is creating flashcards for each topic.

## Parameterized Flashcards (v2.0)

**NEW**: Create flashcards that generate infinite variations with random values!

### What are Parameterized Cards?

Instead of static flashcards that can be memorized, parameterized cards generate new random values each time they're presented:

**Traditional Card:**
- Question: "What is 2 + 3?"
- Answer: "5"
- Problem: Students memorize the answer, not the process

**Parameterized Card:**
- Template: "What is {a} + {b}?"
- Parameters: a = random(1-50), b = random(1-50), c = a + b
- Result: Each time generates new values like "What is 17 + 23?" or "What is 45 + 8?"

### Quick Start with Parameterized Cards

Create example cards for the Basic Arithmetic topic:

```bash
python manage.py create_example_parameterized_cards --user=<your_username>
```

This creates 7 example parameterized cards including:
- Simple Addition: "What is {a} + {b}?"
- Multiplication: "What is {a} × {b}?"
- Pythagorean Theorem: "Triangle with legs {a} and {b}, find hypotenuse"
- Percentage: "What is {percent}% of {number}?"
- And more!

### Creating Your Own Parameterized Cards

Via Django Admin, create a flashcard with:
- **Question Type**: Parameterized/Randomized
- **Question Template**: "What is {a} + {b}?"
- **Answer Template**: "{c}"
- **Parameter Spec** (JSON):
```json
{
  "variables": {
    "a": {"type": "random_int", "min": 1, "max": 50},
    "b": {"type": "random_int", "min": 1, "max": 50},
    "c": {"type": "computed", "formula": "a + b"}
  }
}
```

See `docs/PARAMETERIZED_CARDS_DESIGN.md` for full documentation and advanced examples.

### Branch Protection

To maintain code quality and prevent accidental changes, it's recommended to protect your main branch:

- **Quick Start**: [.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_QUICKSTART.md](.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_QUICKSTART.md) - 5-minute setup
- **Full Guide**: [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md) - Comprehensive documentation
- **Workflow Visual**: [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_WORKFLOW.md](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_WORKFLOW.md) - Visual workflow guide
- **Code Owners**: [.github/CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) - Automated review assignments
- **CI/CD**: [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) - Automated testing and checks

With branch protection enabled:
1. All changes must go through Pull Requests
2. Changes require review and approval  
3. Automated tests must pass before merging
4. Direct pushes to main are prevented
